<p>The statistical analysis in this tab plays a pivotal role in understanding urban mobility dynamics, offering an in-depth view of resource utilization and user behavior across selected zones and time ranges.</p>

<p class="mb-1">On the left-hand side, the layout mirrors the data distribution tab, featuring a selection panel where users can refine their analysis by choosing a specific zone, week of the year, and optional time range. Additionally, a mini-map dynamically highlights the selected elements, providing spatial context. If no selection is made, the data displayed represents cumulative information for the entire city.
    The main content of the tab is organized into eight panels split into four pairs:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Correlation Heatmaps:</b> the left heatmap shows the correlation between the <em>Abusivism Index</em> and the <em>Number of Fines</em> for the selected zone; the right heatmap extends this analysis to the entire city, providing an absolute perspective.
    </li>
    <li><b>Usage Statistics:</b> the left panel displays key metrics for parking meters; the right panel focuses on parking slots, providing also daily influx trends.
    </li>
    <li><b>POI and Events Analysis.</b></li>
    <li><b>Abusivism and Fines Breakdown:</b> presents the <em>Abusivism Index</em> and <em>Number of Fines</em> metrics segmented by agent shifts (morning, afternoon, evening), highlighting trends, p-values, and Sen's Slope.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>All content in the tab is dynamically updated based on user selections, empowering decision-makers to explore detailed insights into the interplay between mobility patterns, parking behavior, and urban events.</p>
