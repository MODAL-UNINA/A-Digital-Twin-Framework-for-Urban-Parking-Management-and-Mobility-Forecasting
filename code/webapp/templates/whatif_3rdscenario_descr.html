<p>In this tab, users can simulate the impact of consecutive rainy days on parking occupancy. Beyond selecting the zone and week of the year for the simulation, users can explore how prolonged rainfall influences parking demand. The simulation only starts when users provide their inputs. Until then, the interface displays a message.</p>

<p>Users can select the desired week of the year, and observe how demand fluctuates across different urban areas. All showed results represent cumulative data for the entire Caserta area under consideration. Additionally, for parking occupancy time series, users can select a specific area of interest to view detailed results. A mini-map highlights the entire area, or the selected zone, and sensors within.</p>

<p>The analysis reveals how adverse weather conditions lead to variations in parking demand. This enables a deeper understanding of weather-related mobility adaptations and parking dynamics.</p>
