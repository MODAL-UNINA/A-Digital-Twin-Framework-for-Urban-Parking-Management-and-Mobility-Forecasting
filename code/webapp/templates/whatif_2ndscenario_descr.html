<p>In this tab, users can simulate the installation of a multistory parking facility in a selected area of interest. Besides choosing the installation zone and the week of the year for the simulation, users must specify the number of additional parking slots the facility will provide, with a minimum default value of 30 slots. This ensures that users can immediately appreciate a redistribution of parking demand that accounts for the new installation. </p>

<p>The simulation only begins once the user inputs their selection. Until then, a message appears. A mini-map highlights: the selected zone; the sensors within the selected area; the nearby zones most impacted by the additional parking slots, determined by a distance threshold.</p>

<p>The results demonstrate the effects of the new parking facility, showcasing a decrease in activity within the selected zone and its neighboring areas. This redistribution leads to a more even allocation of parking demand across the city, reducing congestion in high-demand areas and providing actionable insights for urban planning and resource optimization.</p>
