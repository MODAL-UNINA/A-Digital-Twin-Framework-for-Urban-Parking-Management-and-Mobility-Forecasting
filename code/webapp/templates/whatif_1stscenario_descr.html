<p>In this tab, users can simulate the closure of a specific area in the city of Caserta. For simplicity, we have implemented the option to close an entire zone; however, our model is capable of generating data for more granular scenarios, such as the closure of a single road or the deactivation of an individual sensor. The simulation begins only after the user specifies their zone and the year's week of interest. Until then, a message appears.</p>

<p>The selected zone corresponds to the <q>deactivated/closed</q> area. A mini-map displays the selected zone, the sensors involved in the selection, and the nearest adjacent zone or zones most affected by the imposed closure, based on a distance threshold.</p>

<p>The simulation results contribute to evaluating the impact of a parking zone closure on parking meters and parking slots. The findings reveal that while the closed zone becomes inaccessible, adjacent zones experience a significant increase in activity due to the redistribution of demand.</p>
